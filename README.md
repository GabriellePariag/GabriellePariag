### Hello there!

My name is Gabrielle and I'm an honors undergraduate CS major at the University of Central Florida graduating in May of 2025. I currently am part of the Knights Hack organization, Marching Knights, and Honors Congress!

I'm looking for an internship in tech to develop my professional skills! You can contact me most easily at my email:

Some fun facts about me:
- I'm from the southernmost point of the United States: Key West, FL.
- I love video games! My favorite is Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.
- My biggest passion is giving the gift of learning to other students, I am the co-founder of a non-profit tutoring organization in my hometown!
